# Welcoming Discord Bot using Discord.js
This is a simple Discord bot, coded in JavaScript and the Discord.js library. This bot welcomes new members to a Discord server via one of specified messages, sent to a specified channel on the server.

## Use
In order to use this bot, change the `WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID` variable to the ID of the Discord channel welcoming messages should be sent to.
Change the bot's token in the very last line to the token of your Discord application.
Change the information in the `package.json` file to reflect your bot's data.

*The `README.md` and `LICENSE` files do not have to be included in the bot's folder. All other files do.*
